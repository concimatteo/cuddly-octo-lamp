      <description>There was a time, I used to look into my father&amp;rsquo;s eyes In a happy home, I was a king I had a golden throne Those days are gone, now the memories are on the wall I hear the songs from the places where I was born
Up on the hill, across the blue lake, That&amp;rsquo;s where I had my first heartbreak I still remember how it all changed My father said Don&amp;rsquo;t you worry, don&amp;rsquo;t you worry child See heaven&amp;rsquo;s got a plan for you Don&amp;rsquo;t you worry, don&amp;rsquo;t you worry now Yeah!</description>
